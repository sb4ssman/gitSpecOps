# Working notes

Living todo / scratch pad. Add items freely; **prune regularly**. When something is done, move it
into [`work-log.md`](work-log.md) with an absolute date. Dates are always absolute.

_Last tended: 2026-09-03_

## Open

- [ ] **`.venv` stays package-free — watch for regressions.** `[tool.uv] package = false` makes
  `uv sync` a virtual project (`uv.lock` shows `source = { virtual = "." }`, no `.pth`). If a stray
  `pip install -e .` or a pyproject edit ever re-adds an `__editable__*.pth` / `git_spec_ops*.egg-info`,
  remove it. See [`knowledge/venv-and-editors.md`](knowledge/venv-and-editors.md).
- [ ] **Duplicator modes 1-3 (download-one / upload / migrate): no CLI flags.** Only
  `--batch`/`--single` have them; `--answers FILE` is the stopgap. Low priority — mode 4 is the hot
  path — and the same `parse_args()` pattern applies if it is ever wanted. (The `CommandTimeout`
  retry half of this item was fixed 2026-09-03.)
- [ ] **Sync Suggester roadmap toward the three-machine fleet.** The product goal is recorded in
  [`new-tool-sync-suggester.md`](new-tool-sync-suggester.md#product-goal-stated-by-the-user-2026-09-03):
  three machines point at their GitHub folder, converge on the same orgs/repos, and stay in sync
  with each other and the cloud, making GitKraken's grouping obsolete for many-org sync
  management. Ordered so schema-affecting work lands before any fleet exists:
  1. ~~Manifest schema v2~~ — **done 2026-09-03** (salted `repo_id`, `head` dropped, `fleet_id`
     mismatch detection). Any further schema change still belongs before a real fleet exists.
  2. ~~Fleet convergence~~ — **done 2026-09-03** (`converge`; names peer hashes by enumerating
     candidates through the provider seam and matching the deterministic HMAC). Still open on top
     of it: convergence currently compares against *peers*, not against the org itself — "the org
     has repos nobody in the fleet has" needs `list_repos` over configured namespaces compared to
     the fleet union, which is a small addition to the same module. Also worth adding: the reverse
     direction (repositories this machine has that no peer does — possibly unpushed local-only
     work).
  3. **Source-remote fetching.** Every ↑/↓ today comes from cached remote-tracking refs;
     `upstream_observed_at` rides through the schema but is always `null` because nothing fetches.
     Open decision from the design doc: never / opt-in / scheduled. Opt-in is the safe default.
  4. **Joining a fleet in one step** on machines two and three, and **installing the watch**
     (login task / periodic timer / tray, per OS). `watch` is foreground-only today.
  5. `handoff` — the mutation flow (auto-commit, WIP branches, patch/untracked transfer). Needs
     its own design pass; it must never end up inside the watcher or a scheduled publisher, for
     the same reason `--reconcile`/`--rename-folders` stay interactive-only in the archive tools.
  6. Long-lived stashes: information, or do they block an "all clear"? Currently `stashed` ranks
     above `unknown` but below `ahead`, so it surfaces without shouting.
  7. The **advice → apply** step (clean + behind-only + fresh fetch -> `git pull --ff-only`) stays
     purely advisory until fetching is settled.

- [ ] **Manifest privacy: `branch` and `upstream` are still published in the clear.** v2 closed
  the big holes (salted `repo_id`, `head` dropped — see [`work-log.md`](work-log.md)). Branch names
  were kept deliberately: a hashed branch could be compared but never displayed, and "same repo,
  different branches on two machines" is a condition the fleet view should surface. But
  `feature/acquire-northwind` is exactly the kind of string that should not sit in a cloud folder.
  Options (HMAC it; publish only a configured safe list in the clear; or state plainly that the
  state folder reveals your branch names) are in
  [`knowledge/manifest-privacy.md`](knowledge/manifest-privacy.md). Decide before three machines
  are publishing for real — it is another schema bump.

## Someday / deferred

- `--yes` shipped for the duplicator (2026-08-31, batch + single); no `--dry-run` yet.
  `_legacy_sources/` still left untouched.
- Future direction: the push/"publish" direction for `archive_sync` — design captured in
  [`README.md`](README.md#future-direction-the-push-direction-publish); not started.
- Multi-host support is a stated goal: archive tools first via `shared/providers.py` (one
  `provider_<host>.py` + `register_provider(...)` per host; fix `remote_identity` URL-port
  parsing first). `github-org-duplicator` stays GitHub-specific by design. Auth stays
  user-owned (host CLI logins); no credential management anywhere.
